This JavaScript project is a simple pizza order calculator that allows users to select different types of pizzas, specify the quantity, and then calculate the total cost of their order. The results display the details of the selected pizzas, including their names, quantities, and individual totals, along with the final price of the entire order.
Features:

    Users can select multiple pizzas from a list of options.
    Each pizza type has a predefined name and price.
    Users can input the quantity for each selected pizza.
    The calculator dynamically updates and displays the total cost for each pizza based on the quantity selected.
    The final total cost is displayed after selecting and confirming the order.

Technologies:

    HTML: The structure of the page includes checkboxes for pizza types and input fields for quantities.
    JavaScript: Handles the logic of calculating the order total based on the user's selections and displays the results on the page.

How it Works:

    Pizza Selection: Users are presented with a list of pizzas (e.g., Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Cheese, Supreme).
    Quantity Input: For each pizza, users can specify how many pizzas they want.
    Calculation: When the user clicks the "Calculate Order" button, the script checks which pizzas are selected, calculates the total for each pizza (price Ã— quantity), and sums up the total cost.
    Output: The selected pizzas and their respective quantities and prices are displayed along with the final total cost.
